Tiffany's Hair salon is a school project which aims to to produce an interacting web advestisement using CSS animations.  lay around with illustrator and CSS. It was an assignment to produce an interacting web advestisement using CSS animations. I used a bootstrap slideshow with functioning arrows to simulate a game menu. It is animated with a jello effect for a cute-y feel. The end result is for user to click on the main button to take them towards to main shop's website.
